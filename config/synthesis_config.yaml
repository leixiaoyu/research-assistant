# Cross-Topic Synthesis Configuration
# Phase 3.7: Cross-Topic Knowledge Synthesis
#
# This configuration defines synthesis questions that span multiple research topics.
# The system will aggregate papers from the registry, apply filters, and use LLM
# to synthesize actionable insights.

# Synthesis questions
# Each question defines:
#   - id: Unique slug identifier
#   - name: Human-readable display name
#   - prompt: Complete LLM prompt with template variables
#   - topic_filters: Only include papers from these topics (empty = all)
#   - topic_exclude: Exclude papers from these topics
#   - max_papers: Maximum papers to include
#   - min_quality_score: Minimum quality threshold (0-100)
#   - priority: Processing order (lower = higher priority)

      You are a research synthesis expert specializing in machine translation.

      I have collected {paper_count} research papers from the following
      research topics: {topics}.

      Please analyze these papers to answer the following question:

      **How can we improve machine translation quality for literary and
      long-form content, especially for English-German translation?**

      Focus on:
      1. Key methodological advances specific to long-form content
      2. Challenges unique to EN-DE translation (compound words, word order)
      3. Evaluation metrics suitable for literary/long-form quality
      4. Practical techniques that can be implemented
      5. Gaps in current research that need attention

      Cite specific papers when making claims using [Author Year] format.
