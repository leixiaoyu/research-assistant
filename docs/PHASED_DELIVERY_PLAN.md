## Architecture Foundation

All phases implement components defined in the **[System Architecture](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)** document, which provides:

- Complete layered architecture design
- Detailed data models (Pydantic)
- Component interactions and data flows
- Concurrency and resilience patterns
- Storage and caching strategies
- Observability architecture
- Security implementation
- Deployment architecture

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Layered architecture (CLI → Orchestration → Services → Infrastructure)
2. **Type Safety**: All data structures use Pydantic models
3. **Async-First**: I/O-bound operations use asyncio for performance
4. **Fail-Safe**: Graceful degradation rather than complete failure
5. **Observable**: Structured logging and Prometheus metrics throughout

See [Gap Resolution Matrix](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md#gap-resolution-matrix) for how each architectural gap is addressed.
